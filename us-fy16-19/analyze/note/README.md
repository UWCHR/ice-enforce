This folder contains three notebooks that each provide a descriptive analysis on a different dataset: encounters, arrests, and removals. Each notebook references a dataset and yaml file located elsewhere in the directory structure.

Next steps/to-do:

1) Add crosswalk file to Encounters file for "final_charge_section" (optional)

2) Add any additional analysis desired for individual datasets

3) Create a new notebook file to compare analysis across datasets

4) Import additional datasets for comparison:

    a) Import CBP arrest data (optional)

    b) Check DHS FOIA library for additional data on enforcement (optional)

    c) Import demographic data for analysis

    d) Compare with facilities data
